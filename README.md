# CS-330

The new design skills this project helped me craft was to become a little more familiar with OpenGL. I did not follow any certain design process for my work project because this was my first time doing computational graphics. 

All of the development strategies I used while working on this 3D scene were new because I have not worked with this medium. I do not plan on working with computational graphics at all in the future. 

Computer science helps me to reach my goals by giving me an all around understanding about each topic in the industry.
